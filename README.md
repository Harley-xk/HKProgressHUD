# HKProgressHUD

HKProgressHUD is a simple and clean hud sdk inspired by MBProgressHUD.

##### Why not MBProgressHUD?
MBProgressHUD is too old, it has so much code dealing with ARC and MRC, whitch is hard to read.And it has bugs using in Autolyout system.

HKProgressHUD is easy to use with Objective-C. 
The view is managed by xib and AutoLayout, so it fits any UI situation.
